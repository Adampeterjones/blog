This Blog keeps a track of learning, projects, code and devops developments that I have been working on.
Although pretty bare right now I will be adding more as i try things out.

## What is here 
- deploying multiple containers to eks from gitlab project container registries  
  - this will use the gitlab registry to create and manage deployment tokens
  - create a map for deployments to manage across environments dynamically


## Coming soon
- Go learning
  - base coding examples
    - build with standard tools
    - api builds
  - Pulumi builds
  - Nitric builds

## Watch this space
