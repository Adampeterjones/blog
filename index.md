This Blog keeps track of learning and project work that I have been around code and devops developments
Although pretty bare right now I will be adding more as i try things out.

  - create a map for deployments to manage across environments dynamically
- Go learning
  - base coding examples
    - build with standard tools
    - api builds
  - Pulumi builds
